#
#   There are a lot of generic boilerplate CMake directives required to
#   generate modern C++ code.  This particular snippet handles the required
#   directives to generate compiler flags that support C++11 specifically on
#   most platforms, but with a few tweaks it could be made to support any other
#   specific modern C++ standard.
#
#   To use, simply add include this snippet *after* your top-level
#   CMakeLists.txt project declaration.
